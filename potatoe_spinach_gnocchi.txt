Potatoe spinach gnocchi

Ingredients:
1 lb potatoes 450g
4 1/2 oz spinach 125g, weight after any stems have been removed
1 egg
1 cup all purpose flour 140g plain flour
1 dash nutmeg
salt and papper
1/4 cup parmesan 10g, finely grated
2 tbsp cream cheese optional

Instructions:
Peel and boil the potatoes until tender.
Place spinach in a bowl, pour over the water from the potatoes and leave for a couple minutes to wilt.
Drain both the potatoes and spinach. Place spinach in a dish towel and squeeze out as much water as possible.
Roughly chop the spinach and add to the potatoes. Blend both together - this can be easier after giving the potatoes a bit of a mash first.
Allow the potato-spinach mixture to cool then add the remaining ingredients and mix well.
Flour a work surface and your hands.
Take large spoonfuls of the mixture and roll out into a log then cut off chunks and roll into balls.
Bring a shallow pan of water to the boil. Add a few gnocchi at a time to the water, keeping it boiling.
When the gnocchi rise to the top, remove with a slotted spoon to an oiled bowl and repeat.
Serve with pesto, or simply olive oil and topped with parmesan.

Notes:
I'd recommend cooking these in a wide, shallow pan such as Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 5-1/2-Quart Saute Pan or Le Creuset Enameled Cast-Iron Round Braiser.
